# Business Project Manager

## Overview

The Business Project Manager is a Kanban-based tool for tracking and managing company-building ventures, specifically focused on **retail businesses with a SaaS component**. While the Real Estate Project Manager tracks physical development projects through construction phases, this board tracks the lifecycle of building and growing companies from initial idea validation through sustainable profitability.

## Project Stages

Unlike real estate projects which follow construction milestones, business projects progress through validation and growth stages. Each stage has specific entry criteria that must be met before advancing.

- Establishing key metrics and tracking
- Team building for core functions

### Key Metrics to Track
| Metric | Target Direction | Notes |
|--------|------------------|-------|
| Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) | ↑ Growing | Consistent growth trend |
| Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) | ↓ Decreasing | Becoming more efficient |
| Churn Rate | ↓ Decreasing | Below 5% monthly ideal |
| Net Promoter Score (NPS) | ↑ Increasing | > 30 is good |
| Time to Value | ↓ Decreasing | Faster onboarding |

### Exit Criteria (to advance to Positive Unit Economics)
- [ ] Consistent customer acquisition for 3+ months

- [ ] Clear understanding of ideal customer profile
- [ ] Repeatable sales/acquisition process
- [ ] Product core features stable

---

## Stage 3: Positive Unit Economics

### Definition
The business has achieved profitability at the individual customer level. Revenue from each customer covers all costs associated with acquiring and serving that customer, with margin to spare.

> **Connection to Unit Economy Tab**: This stage validates that the subscription packages defined in the Unit Economy tab are profitable in practice. The `Suggested Price` you set must exceed the `Cost` for each package, and your actual revenue must reflect this. If your planned unit economics from the Unit Economy tab aren't materializing, revisit your pricing or cost structure.

### Characteristics
- **Legal Status**: Established, possibly restructured for growth
- **Investment**: May be seeking Series A or profitable enough to self-fund
- **Team**: Growing team with specialized roles
- **Product**: Mature product with clear roadmap
- **Revenue**: Consistent, growing, and profitable per customer

### Entry Criteria (all must be true)
1. **Revenue per user beats cost per user** - LTV > CAC (ideally 3x+)
2. **Positive margin on every customer** - No loss leaders or subsidized customers
3. **Scalable acquisition cost** - CAC doesn't balloon with growth
4. **Positive gross margin** - Revenue minus direct costs is positive
5. **Cash positive on operations** - Day-to-day operations don't burn cash
6. **Predictable churn** - Can forecast customer retention accurately
7. **No hidden subsidies** - True costs are reflected (no founder salary deferral, etc.)

### Activities in This Stage
- Scaling customer acquisition
- Building growth team
- Operational efficiency improvements
- Geographic or segment expansion
- Feature development for retention
- Building management layer

### Key Metrics to Track
| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| LTV:CAC Ratio | > 3:1 | Healthy unit economics |
| Gross Margin | > 70% | For SaaS component |
| Payback Period | < 12 months | Time to recoup CAC |
| Monthly Burn Rate | ↓ Approaching 0 | Moving toward profitability |
| Revenue per Employee | ↑ Increasing | Operational efficiency |

### Exit Criteria (to advance to Sustainable Growth)
- [ ] 3+ consecutive months of positive unit economics
- [ ] Gross margin stable or improving
- [ ] CAC payback period under 12 months
- [ ] No operational cash burn
- [ ] Scalable processes documented

---

## Stage 4: Sustainable Growth

### Definition
The company has achieved complete positive cash flow while demonstrating sustainable growth. Growth is funded by reinvesting profits rather than external capital. A financial cushion exists for unexpected challenges.

### Characteristics
- **Legal Status**: Stable, possibly preparing for larger financing or exit
- **Investment**: Self-funding growth from profits
- **Team**: Scaled team with management structure
- **Product**: Platform with multiple products/features
- **Revenue**: Predictable, growing, with healthy margins

### Entry Criteria (all must be true)
1. **Consistent unit economics over 3+ months** - Not a one-time achievement
2. **Positive cash flow overall** - Company-wide, not just per customer
3. **Steady month-over-month growth** - Sustainable rate (10-20% MoM typical)
4. **Reinvestment without outside funds** - Growth funded by revenue
5. **Stable churn and acquisition** - Predictable, manageable metrics
6. **Buffer for surprises** - 6+ months runway in reserves
7. **Team focused on strategy, not firefighting** - Operational stability

### Activities in This Stage

- Market expansion (new segments, geographies)
- M&A considerations (acquiring or being acquired)
- Building competitive moats
- Team development and culture building
- Governance and board development

### Key Metrics to Track
| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Month-over-Month Growth | 10-20% | Sustainable rate |
| Cash Runway | > 6 months | Buffer for downturns |
| Rule of 40 | > 40% | Growth rate + profit margin |
| Employee NPS | > 50 | Team health |
| Market Share | ↑ Increasing | Competitive position |

### Maintenance Criteria (to stay in this stage)

## Tabs Structure (per Business Project)

### Tab 1: Unit Economy
Define subscription packages to establish the unit economics foundation for the business. This is where you plan the pricing and cost structure that needs to become profitable.

**Purpose**: Before launching, define what you're selling and at what economics. These packages become the benchmarks for achieving Positive Unit Economics (Stage 3).

**For each subscription package**:
- **Name** - Package tier name (e.g., "Basic", "Pro", "Enterprise")
- **Value Description** - Text describing what's included (features, benefits)
- **Value Metric** - Numeric measure of value delivered (e.g., "10 hours/month", "100 units", "5 users")
- **Suggested Price** - Target price point for this package
- **Cost** - Cost to deliver this package to one customer

**Key insight**: When `Suggested Price > Cost` for all packages and you have paying customers, you're on your way to Positive Unit Economics.

### Tab 2: Overview
- Company name, description, industry
- Current stage with progress indicator
- Stage entry date and time in stage
- Quick metrics summary (MRR, customers, runway)
- Founders and team overview

### Tab 3: Stage Criteria
- Interactive checklist for current stage criteria
- Progress toward next stage
- Historical stage transitions
- Notes and evidence for each criterion

### Tab 4: Financials
- Monthly metrics input/display
- MRR/ARR charts
- Burn rate tracking
- Runway projections
- Investment tracking (rounds, amounts, investors)

### Tab 5: Customers
- Customer count and growth
- Churn tracking and analysis
- LTV/CAC calculations
- Customer cohort analysis
- NPS tracking

### Tab 6: Team
- Founders and equity structure
- Team roster and roles
- Hiring plan
- Org chart

### Tab 7: Docs
- Link external documents (pitch decks, legal docs, contracts)
- Categorized by type (Legal, Financial, Product, etc.)
- Same functionality as Real Estate Docs tab

---

## UI/UX Considerations

### Kanban Board
- 4 columns for 4 stages
- Project cards show: Name, MRR, Runway, Stage progress %
- Color coding by health (green = on track, yellow = needs attention, red = at risk)
- Quick actions: Move stage, Add note, View details

### Stage Transitions
- Cannot skip stages (must progress linearly)
- Moving forward requires checklist completion confirmation
- Moving backward allowed (things don't always go forward)
- Audit log of all stage changes

### Mobile Considerations
- Same 2-column button grid for tabs on mobile
- Swipe between stages on Kanban
- Quick metric entry for monthly updates

---

## User Management & Permissions

### Ownership Model
- **Same as Real Estate Projects** - the user who creates a project is the owner
- Owner can add **collaborators** to the project
- Collaborators have access to view and edit the project
- Only owner can delete the project or manage collaborators

### Collaboration
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Project: "RetailTech SaaS"                          │
│  Owner: alice@example.com                            │
│  Collaborators: bob@example.com, carol@example.com   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Adding Collaborators
- Via email address (must have existing account)
- Invited users see the project in their Kanban board
- Can be removed by owner at any time

---

## Board Visibility Rules

### Key Principle: No Empty Boards

> **If a user has no projects of a specific type, they do not see that Kanban board at all.**

This keeps the interface clean and focused on what's relevant to each user.

### Visibility Logic

```
For each board type (Real Estate, Business):
  - Count projects where user is owner OR collaborator
  - If count > 0: Show the Kanban board
  - If count = 0: Hide the Kanban board entirely
```

### User Experience Examples

| User Scenario | What They See |
|---------------|---------------|
| User has 2 Real Estate projects, 0 Business projects | Only Real Estate Kanban |
| User has 0 Real Estate projects, 3 Business projects | Only Business Kanban |
| User has projects in both types | Both Kanban boards |
| New user with no projects | Welcome screen / "Create your first project" |

### Creating First Project of a Type
- User can create a new project type from a global "New Project" action
- After creation, the corresponding Kanban board becomes visible
- Board appears immediately upon project creation

### Navigation Structure

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
